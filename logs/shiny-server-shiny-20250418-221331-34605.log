Warning: The arguments of `page_navbar()` for navbar options (including `position`,
`bg`) have been consolidated into a single `navbar_options` argument and was
deprecated in bslib 0.9.0.
ℹ See `navbar_options()` for more details.
ℹ The deprecated feature was likely used in the bslib package.
  Please report the issue at <https://github.com/rstudio/bslib/issues>.
